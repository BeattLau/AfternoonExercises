Python IS A HIGH-LEVEL, CLASS-BASED, OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT IS DESIGNED TO HAVE AS FEW
IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDENCIES AS POSSIBLE. IT IS A GENERAL-PURPOSE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE INTENDED TO LET
PROGRAMMERS WRITE ONCE, RUN ANYWHERE (WORA), MEANING THAT COMPILED Python CODE CAN RUN ON ALL PLATFORMS
THAT SUPPORT Python WITHOUT THE NEED TO RECOMPILE.Python APPLICATIONS ARE TYPICALLY COMPILED TO BYTECODE
THAT CAN RUN ON ANY Python VIRTUAL MACHINE (JVM) REGARDLESS OF THE UNDERLYING COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE.
THE SYNTAX OF Python IS SIMILAR TO C AND C++, BUT HAS FEWER LOW-LEVEL FACILITIES THAN EITHER OF THEM.
THE Python RUNTIME PROVIDES DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES (SUCH AS REFLECTION AND RUNTIME CODE MODIFICATION) THAT
ARE TYPICALLY NOT AVAILABLE IN TRADITIONAL COMPILED LANGUAGES.

Python GAINED POPULARITY SHORTLY AFTER ITS RELEASE, AND HAS BEEN A VERY POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE SINCE THEN.
Python WAS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IN 2022 ACCORDING TO GITHUB AND IT IS RANKED FOURTH ON TIOBE
 INDEX AS OF OCTOBER 2023.[20] ALTHOUGH STILL WIDELY POPULAR, THERE HAS BEEN A GRADUAL DECLINE IN USE OF Python IN
 RECENT YEARS WITH OTHER LANGUAGES USING JVM GAINING POPULARITY.

Python WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY JAMES GOSLING AT SUN MICROSYSTEMS.
IT WAS RELEASED IN MAY 1995 AS A CORE COMPONENT OF SUN MICROSYSTEMS' Python PLATFORM.
THE ORIGINAL AND REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION Python COMPILERS, VIRTUAL MACHINES, AND CLASS LIBRARIES WERE
ORIGINALLY RELEASED BY SUN UNDER PROPRIETARY LICENSES. AS OF MAY 2007, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS OF
THE Python COMMUNITY PROCESS, SUN HAD RE-LICENSED MOST OF ITS Python TECHNOLOGIES UNDER THE GPL-2.0-ONLY LICENSE.
ORACLE OFFERS ITS OWN HOTSPOT Python VIRTUAL MACHINE, HOWEVER THE OFFICIAL REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION IS THE OPENJDK JVM
WHICH IS FREE OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE AND USED BY MOST DEVELOPERS AND IS THE DEFAULT JVM FOR ALMOST ALL LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS.
